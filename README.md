# ðŸ©º Predictive Health Assessment  

This project **statistical learning and data mining techniques** to healthcare survey data to identify lifestyle-driven health risks and build predictive models for health outcomes.  

The repository demonstrates the **end-to-end data science pipeline**:  
- Data collection & cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model development (supervised & unsupervised)  
- Validation and evaluation  
- Communication via **poster, report, and presentation**

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Explore and preprocess real-world health survey data.  
- Use **classification models** to predict health outcomes based on lifestyle factors.  
- Apply **unsupervised learning** (clustering, PCA) to uncover hidden population subgroups.  
- Evaluate performance of different models under **cross-validation**.  
- Translate technical results into insights that can inform health interventions.
